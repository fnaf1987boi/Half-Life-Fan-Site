    <p>[Valve Theme plays] ahh, Half-Life...</p>
    <p>Half-Life is truly the best game in the world, and it always will be. No matter WHO you are, you love it; everyone who touches Half-Life LOVES it. It's one of the very few things that are like that.</p>
    <p>If only there was a GitHub-hosted webpage designed for Half-Life fans to glaze Half-Life...</p>
    <p>Oh wait!</p>
    <p>There is! And it's here! This is that webpage! Welcome... to the Half-Life Fan Site!</p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff9900">Gordon Freeman</h2>
    <p>Gordon Freeman is Half-Life's protagonist. Silent but deadly, Freeman became one of the most influencial video game characters of all time. He carries a crowbar as he navigates Black Mesa (the research facility he works at) and fights aliens that invaded Earth after the resonance cascade Freeman may or may not have caused. And he never says a word... which seems very hard to do considering he's a very important person, and everyone treats him with respect because he is supposed to be the savior of the world.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff9900">G-Man</h2>
    <p>So Half-Life already has a protagonist and many threats to fight him, but what about an ANtagonist? That's where the G-Man comes in. The G-Man is the head of it all; the Keeper of the Universe, if you will. The reason Freeman is able to do what he does. The G-Man seems to be behind everything. He seems all-knowing. He seems... strange... and he seems like he's behind everything that happens in the game. He's an NPC, and he appears in some cut scenes, but he's not like the others; you can find him in random spots in the world, but not for long, as he always seems to dissapear in inhuman ways every time. He is truly a wonder.</p>
