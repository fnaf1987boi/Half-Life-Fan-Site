    <h1>The secret room</h1>
    <p>Congratulations! You found the secret room. Honestly, I didn't make it too hard for you to do so, but you did it! Good for you.</p>
    <p>There won't be a bright orange footer to comfort you this time, young user. Honestly, I hope this room is the most uncomfortable room for you. I hope you hate it. I hope you regret clicking on that question mark in the crowbar room. I hope you HATE. THIS. ROOM. Notice how there's nothing to do in this room. Does that make you feel uneasy? Does it? Maybe not. There's not much to do in the entire site, but at least all the other rooms are more fun than THIS.</p>
    <p>To tell the truth, the fact I gave you the option to go back to the crowbar room is me being generous, as the original secret room was meant to be a dead end, and you would have to re-open the site entirely.</p>
