    <h1>Crowbar room</h1>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to the crowbar room. Below are accounts of various employees at Black Mesa on the day they created the fall of man.</p>
    <b>Doctor Jeffery Tuckerstein</b>
    <p>We didn't know what was going on. All we knew was Smithers had some sort of blob-spider on his head, and it was tranforming him into an undiscovered creature of some kind. it was a horrifying sight to see. I was one of the few from room A-C: 14 to survive. I heard. A-D: 14 didn't make it, and that room had around 15 people in it!</p>
    <b>Doctor Tim Smith</b>
    <p>I thought it was a pipe bursting.</p>
    <b>Doctor Matthew Millie Johnson</b>
    <p>I was roaming the corridor just outside of the test chamber... you know, the ones with military computers lining the walls? I was asked to turn knob T-20, I think. I never made it to that knob. I was just past the column that houses U-9 [a button], waving at Doctor Cameron, when all of a sudden one of the computers blows up and catches fire. A laser, whcich I assume came from one of the electric valves in the computer bursts out from the metal and explodes him! There was blood everywhere...</p>
    <b>Officer Alphred Gunn</b>
    <p>I was trying to get some Skittles out of the vending machine. I lost my leg to an explosion coming from a vent near the floor.</p>
    <b>Doctor Juncubre</b>
    <p>I knew exacty what was going on. Coomer KNEW the test wouldn't work. He did it anyway. It costed so many lives. I hate him.</p>
