    <p>In 1999, the Black Mesa research facility was the only research facility of its kind because of the intellegence of the employees (scientists) that roamed its corridors. Black Mesa was the research facility made from the brightest minds in the world. It was unstoppable at the awards, and Gordon Freeman was among the many scientists to descover and test on Xen crystals. Using the power from the crystals, they thought, they could improve technology on Earth. A lot to say, given they had the technology to visit other planets via teleportation. But, the plan to study the crystals was interupted by a man in a blue suit carrying a breifcase. He told them the dangers of doing such a thing, and that it would require a level of science no one has ever reached yet. Not even Black Mesa. He also the provider of the crystal sample that started the resonance cascade. Is HE to blame? Or is Freeman? I say both. It's on the man in the blue suit for providing Black Mesa with a faulty sample, and it's on Freeman and the science team for testing on it when they knew something was wrong. Everyone made a mistake that day, but no one admitted it. Everyone blamed someone else. Justified behavior, because that was a tragedy. That one event marked the fall of man. And the world's best and brightest are the reason for that? There has to be something deeper going on here. To this day, we don't really know what ACTUALLY caused the fabric of time and space to tear that day.</p>
