    <p>We didn't know what was going on. All we knew was Smithers had some sort of blob-spider on his head, and it was tranforming him into an undiscovered creature of some kind. it was a horrifying sight to see. I was one of the few from room A-C: 14 to survive. I heard. A-D: 14 didn't make it, and that room had around 15 people in it!</p>
    <b>Doctor Tim Smith</b>

    <b>Doctor Matthew Millie Johnson</b>
    <p>I was roaming the corridor just outside of the test chamber... you know, the ones with military computers lining the walls? I was asked to turn knob T-20, I think. I never made it to that knob. I was just past the column that houses U-9 [a button], waving at Doctor Cameron, when all of a sudden one of the computers blows up and catches fire. A laser, whcich I assume came from</p>
