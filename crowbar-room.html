    <h1>Crowbar room</h1>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to the crowbar room. Below are accounts of various employees at Black Mesa on the day they created the fall of man.</p>
    <b>Doctor Jeffery Tuckerstein</b>
    <p>We didn't know what was going on. All we knew was Smithers had some sort of blob-spider on his head, and it was tranforming him into an undiscovered creature of some kind. it was a horrifying sight to see. I was one of the few from room A-C: 14 to survive. I heard. A-D: 14 didn't make it, and that room had around 15 people in it!</p>
    <b>Doctor Tim Smith</b>
    <p>I thought it was a pipe bursting.</p>
    <b>Doctor Matthew Millie Johnson</b>
    <p>I was roaming the corridor just outside of the test chamber... you know, the ones with military computers lining the walls? I was asked to turn knob T-20, I think. I never made it to that knob. I was just past the column that houses U-9 [a button], waving at Doctor Cameron, when all of a sudden one of the computers blows up and catches fire. A laser, whcich I assume came from one of the electric valves in the computer bursts out from the metal and explodes him! There was blood everywhere...</p>
    <b>Officer Alphred Gunn</b>
    <p>I was trying to get some Skittles out of the vending machine. I lost my leg to an explosion coming from a vent near the floor.</p>
    <b>Doctor Juncubre</b>
    <p>I knew exacty what was going on. Coomer KNEW the test wouldn't work. He did it anyway. It costed so many lives. I hate him.</p>
    <b>G-Man Cult Member #7</b>
    <p>I knew this would happen. What Freeman did is very smart, but also very dangerous...</p>
    <b>G-Man Cult Member #2</b>
    <p>After the unfortunate and cosmic death of the G-Man Cult Leader [Member #1], I was asked to take over. We worship his employers, and we serve the G-Man's purpose of taking the most important individuals in the universe, and saving them in the stoage of eternity until they're needed again. Freeman made a very poor choice for humanity, but the right choice in the eyes of He Who Rules Existance. We know the truth. We know Doctor Freeman knows the truth. We will do everything to make sure the Free Man uses that knowlage to aid him in his galactic journey, or his Earthly one, for that matter. He is the Most Important Man in the Universe. We don't worship him, but we might as well. We hope he knows that. We hope he does.</p>
