# Half-Life-Fan-Site
Hello and welcome to the UNOFFICIAL (obviously) Half-Life website, made by just a fan! This is the place where Half-Life fans can unite. And if you'll alow it, I'd like to tell you about how I fell in love with Valve's 1998 FPS.
It was the summer of 2024. I had just watched the Kelski video on how "Half-Life has more life than modern games." (Couldn't agree more.) And although I woud love to say I discovered Half-Life on my own, I didn't. But the good news is: the first time I was introduced to Half-Life, it was being glazed. Meaning: the first thing I was told about Half-Life was how good it was. It was a pretty good introduction, and I'm proud of the opinion it formed.
From that point on, I would bother my friends about it until they played it, and I would inform my parents autistically until they got the idea. I made it a part of my life, and I love it to death.
I hope you do, too, because these files are full of Half-Life goodness.
And if my name sounds familiar (which it probably doesn't), I am the homie that made CM.
